# TP53-Genetic-Analysis-Report
Given the role of the TP53 gene in the development of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), thepurpose of this paper is to explore the genetic analysis of TP53 by looking at its gene expression and germline mutation.

The TP53 gene on chromosome 17 is “the guardian of the genome” by ensuring stable tumor
suppression, DNA repair, and cell division through the creation of p53 protein. Mutated TP53
changes a single amino acid in p53, causing the protein to lose control of cell division and unable
to trigger programmed cell death in cells with mutated or damaged DNA. The mutation is linked
to the formation of cancer tumors, commonly breast and brain tumors, soft tissue and bone
sarcomas, and ACC. The inability to suppress tumors led researchers to connect LFS and to p53
germline mutations in a cell. LFS patients inherit one copy of a mutated TP53 gene from each
cell, and in some cases, inherited from a parent. The parent has a 50% chance of passing an
LFS-causative pathogenic variant to the offspring [1,5]. 75% of patients have this germline TP53
mutation. For patients without a parental history of LFS, the disease can occur from a TP53
pathogenic variant. Cancers associated with the TP53 gene have low survivability rates, and
chemotherapy treatments are less effective than other cancers—also, patients who have cancer
due to this gene experience high relapse rates than other cancer patients [7,8,9].
